## Welcome to my page!

I created this site on GitHub Pages. I'm using this page to learn about full stack web development. Specifically, I'm learning:
* Ruby on Rails
* Git
* HTML and CSS
* Continuing my studies of JS

GitHub Pages runs [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in my website.
